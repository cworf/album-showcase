Using everything you've learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, create an app that allows users to showcase music album artwork.

Include a basic form to add new artwork. Use jQuery in order to insert image URIs into your HTML.
Use JavaScript objects, constructors, and prototypes. Object properties may include the name of the band, the title of the album, its release year, and of course, an image URI.
You don't have a database to work with, unfortunately, but using what you know about Javascript objects and arrays, it should be easy to find a workaround (kind of how you did during Intro group week).

Add some unique features, like the ability to rate, leave comments, or emulate purchases.
Look for opportunities to incorporate Flexbox as well as transitions, transforms, and animations.
